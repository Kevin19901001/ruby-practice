# The first part of I/O interface:
print "Enter your name:"
name = gets
puts name


# The module 'kernel' has implemented all 'I/O' related methods: gets, open, print, printf, putc, puts, readline, readlinesand test, they make ruby programming easy.


# The second way is using I/O object:
# Ruby has defined a basic class 'IO' to manage input and output. Class 'File' and 'BasicSocket' are both subclass of class 'IO'.
